# RejsUd

If you have a KU credit card and need to settle expenses, you can do so using
[RejsUd2](https://kunet.ku.dk/faculty-and-department/diku/finances/Pages/expense-claims.aspx).

## What do I put for the Alias/Sted/KU Specifikation fields on the settlement page?
See [here](https://kunet.ku.dk/faculty-and-department/diku/finances/Pages/Unit-number-alias-UCPH-specification.aspx).

## Checklist for reimbursement after conference trip

You need:

* PDF invoice for hotel
* PDF invoice for conference
* PDF invoice from Carlson Wagonlit (CWT, the travel agent)
* (Generally, invoice for any expense, but these three are unavoidable)
* PDF of the conference programme (hopefully can be printed from conference website).

1. For "Afregningsskabelon" pick "2 - Travel settlements".
2. Fill in your sted/alias/spec, travel days, start/end-date, and so on.
3. Add the various expenses.  Note that CWT is usually *two* expenses
   (ticket and "travel fee").  Attach invoices/bills to the relevant
   expenses.  You do not need to add anything for the CWT travel free.
4. Under "Rejsedage" (or the "Travel" tab if you're using CWT in English) you add the travel days and indicate for each day
   how you want to be reimbursed (e.g. which meals were included as
   part of the hotel/conference stay).

So for the most common expenses you need the following attachments:

* **CWT ticket**
  1. The confirmation/ticket/travel-document from CWT.
* **CWT travel fee**
  * Nothing!
* **Conference registration**
  1. Conference program.
  2. Bill or invoice.
* **Hotel**
  1. Bill or invoice.
