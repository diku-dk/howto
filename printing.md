# Printing at DIKU

The easiest way is to use [webprint](https://webprint.ku.dk/).

 - After logging in, choose "Web Print" on the left.
 - Choose "Submit a Job"
 - Choose how you want to print (color/gresycale, duplex/simplex). Don't worry
   about the weird long name at the
   front. `prtskyq02pw\WebPrint_q02_A4_Greyscale_Duplex (virtual)` is usually
   good enough.
 - Choose how many copies you want to print
 - Upload the file you want to print
 - Physically go to the mobility printer and scan your KU ID-card.
 - Select "Print all" on the printer
