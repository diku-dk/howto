# How do I DIKU?

How indeed.  This is supposed to be a written form of unofficial
**public** institutional knowledge that isn't a good fit for the
intranet (also, easier to edit).

## Intranet pointers

The [DIKU
intranet](https://kunet.ku.dk/faculty-and-department/diku/Pages/default.aspx)
on KUnet has good and up-to-date information.  Rather than duplicate
it, here's links to frequently useful bits:

* [Academic Calender for SCIENCE](https://kunet.ku.dk/faculty-and-department/science/study-administration/academic-calendar/Pages/default.aspx)
  with nice printable overviews.

* [Who to contact](https://kunet.ku.dk/faculty-and-department/diku/contact/Pages/default.aspx)
  - For generic approval of administrative things (collaboration
    agreements etc) contact the Head of Administration:
    <headofadministration@di.ku.dk>

* [Phonebook](https://kunet.ku.dk/oevrige/telefonbog), where you can
  lookup the names and/or email addresses of an employee or student,
  based on their name and/or email address.

## Figuring out what's for lunch

The lunch menus for the canteens at HCÃ˜ and Bio are available
[here](https://www.foodandco.dk/besog-os-her/restauranter/ku/norre-campus/). The
menu for the pharma canteen is supposed to be available
[here](https://ku-sund.bychartwells.dk/#ath), but it doesn't work as of this
writing.
