# Eduroam

The wireless network at DIKU is called Eduroam. The nice thing about
Eduroam is that your connection settings should work at any university
that also uses Eduroam (actual experience may vary). On Linux, use the
following settings:

* SSID: eduroam

* Security: WPA & WPA2 Enterprise

* Authentication: PEAP

* Anonymous identity: `anonymous@ku.dk` (may not matter)

* PEAP version: Automatic

* Inner authentication: MSCHAPv2

* Username `username@ku.dk`, e.g. `mzd885@ku.dk` if you are
  [Troels](http://hjemmesider.diku.dk/~athas/).

* Password: your KU password (meaning you'll have to change it ever so often).
